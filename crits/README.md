- What stage is it at?
- What kind of feedback do you want?
- Who are the users?
- What are the user needs?
- What is the policy intent?
- What assumptions or constraints are you working with?

## Criticism vs Critique

- Criticism passes judgement — **Critique poses questions**
- Criticism finds fault — Critique **uncovers opportunity**
- Criticism is personal — Critique **is objective**
- Criticism is vague — Critique **is concrete**
- Criticism tears down — Critique **builds up**
- Criticism is ego-centric — Critique **is altruistic**
- Criticism is adversarial — Critique **is cooperative**
- Criticism belittles the designer — Critique **improves the design**
